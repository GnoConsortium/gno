Unlike the rest of the source, we don't build the docs under
the GS itself.  Currently (summer 2012) the build machine is
a CentOS 5.x server.  (The GS cannot handle the tool chain
currently used to build docs.)  Incidentally, this is why the
makefiles in this hierarchy are called GNUmakefile instead of
Makefile; there is no GNU make for the GS, so you can't 
accidentally trigger a make in this directory on a GS (or if
you do, it won't get very far.

CONFIGURATION
=============

Create the file etc/constpriv.mk and add this line:
	GNO_PUBLIC_HTML = /home/myname/public_html/gno

Of course, change that to whereever you prefer.  This file is
ignored by the repository, so you will not see it checked in.

DOCUMENT BUILD
==============

To build the documents, you will need to have installed:
	GNU make
	docbook
	tetex-latex
	latex-dvips
	latex2html

In order to build the reference manuals, do the following:
	make

That will cause the documentation to be generated into the 'gen'
hierarchy.

DOCUMENT INSTALLATION
=====================

This should normally only be done for the official GNO web server.

To install the reference manuals:
	make install
