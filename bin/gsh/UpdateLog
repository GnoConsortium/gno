GSH 2.0 UPDATES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

24 Apr 98    [gdr] Fitted gsh sources into into GNO builds.  While gsh
	     assembles and links (abeit using the v2.0.4 termcap library),
	     it does not currently run -- it just crashes.  The changes
	     that were made includes:
	     - 'keep' lines were eliminated
	     - the 'mcopy' now takes the macro from the /obj/gno/bin/gsh
	       directory.  This is in anticipation of having the macro
	       files generated from a single source file; there is a large
	       amount of duplication.  For the moment, the makefile merely
	       copies the old macro files from the "M" directory to the
	       /obj/gno/bin/gsh directory.
	     - start each file with a dummy routine so that the source
	       code winds up in the *.o rather than the *.root file.
	     - added the 'setcom 60' directive; there were many source
	       lines that were otherwise getting truncated.

18 Nov 97    - [gdr] initial checkin into v2.0.6 repository.  No changes
	       were made to the sources.

GSH 1.1 UPDATES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 (unknown)   - Removed two references to $E0C000 in shell.asm (signal
	       handlers).  Bad Timmy!
 2/25/92 d01 - fixed a problem with the command-line aborting after certain
               built-ins are run.
 4/03/92 d02 - .ttya and .ttyb are displayed as 'ta' and 'tb' respectively in
               'ps'.
             - "USER" field has been renamed to "MMID" in 'ps'.
         d03 - removed all the extra newlines around 'There are stopped jobs'
               message.
             - 'exit' in a shell script aborts the script, instead of quitting
               gsh itself.
             - when getting a 'There are stopped jobs' message, a second
               attempt to exit the shell will result in all jobs being killed
               and the shell will exit. No commands may appear between the
               two attempts to exit. This is basically just like csh behaviour.
         d04 - motd pathname has been changed to '31:etc:motd' where 31 is the
               location of GNO, not the user directory. eventually motd will
               be removed from gsh and will be handled by login or something
               similar.
 4/07/92 d05 - ^D and TAB expansion now properly works on */ boot prefix.
 4/13/92 d06 - started work on new string vector library.
             - started new builtin - 'hash' to display all hashed files.
               Extremely preliminary.
 4/14/92 d07 - 'hash' now uses string vectors to build the hash list for
               displaying
             - fixed a problem if no files were hashed.
             - sv_alloc now makes sure there is an extra null at the end
               of the allocated string vector.
 4/20/92 d08 - 'which' puts the filename after the path for commands in
               the current directory.
         d09 - wrote a string vector function for printing the string
               vectors in columns like 'ls'. 'hash' now calls this.
 4/21/92 d10 - wrote routine for sorting string vectors...'hash' now sorts the
               list...
 4/23/92 d11 - full directory stack support!! pushd, popd, and dirs!!
         d12 - 'ps' displays 'nu' for the .null driver under TT field.
 4/25/92 d13 - Added '-l' option to 'kill'.
 6/22/92 d14 - Began writing custom stdio for the shell using GS/OS output.
 6/23/92     - minor optimization to alias hashing.
             - finished stdout and stderr for gsh.
         d15 - history file is no longer deleted on gsh start-up
             - fixed '~' printer used in 'dirs'. /usr2/ was displayed as
               ~2 if $home was /usr. Looked real dumb :) and was incorrect.
             - optimizations to job control
         d16 - echo flushes the stdio when finished.
 6/24/92     - fixed bug in system() call vector..make should work better
	       now :)
             - added a newline after 'pwd'.
             - wrote 'edit' built-in.
 6/26/92 d17 - began work on stdin for gsh. Uses GS/OS, ioctl(), etc...
             - began rewriting editor. Now uses key translation tables and
               command jump tables.
             - editor now accepts multiple character commands.
 6/27/92     - further work on editor
             - started work on termcap support in gsh. most command-line
               editing uses termcap now.
 6/28/92     - continued work on editor and termcap
             - 'clear' and 'echo' builtins now use termcap.
             - prompt now uses termcap.
             - hacked up a quick 'tset' builtin.
             - wrote keybinding function, termcap arrow keys now bound!
             - beta test release sent out
 6/29/92 d18 - if alias 'precmd' is defined, it is executed before drawing
               each prompt.
             - if $pushdsilent is set, then directory stack not displayed
               after 'pushd' and 'popd'.
             - termcap optimizations for history mechanism in editor.
             - termcap optimizations for kill-line and kill-end-of-line.
             - fixed bug in overwrite mode of editor...required too many
               returns to end line -> rts's weren't being pulled off the
               stack :)
 6/30/92     - fixed a bug in the 'which' command when displaying files in cwd.
             - the cursor is now left on when running applications.
             - added '-c' option to gsh command-line
             - wrote 'source' built-in
 7/04/92     - fixed two bugs in prompt display code.
 7/17/92     - fixed puts to not choke on NULL strings.
 7/21/92     - Temporarily added Push/PopVariables to the code
             - ospeed is now set so that padding can be done by termcap.
               This fixed the dropped characters on my Xerox terminal when
               doing screen clears.
             - fixed a bug in 'tset'. Was doing a jsr instead of jsl. oops.
             - set term can be in gshrc w/o manually doing a tset now.
             - 'ps' now scans job list to find names of 'forked' processes.
             - 'ps' nows displays tty numbers, since the ttyname is set
               in 31/etc/ttys and not necessarily second-guessed by gsh.
 7/25/92     - fixed cursor off problems.
 8/26/92 d19 - larger number of builtins can be redirected or piped.
             - Open-Apple is now mapped to meta (ESC).
             - The editor tells gnocon to translate arrows into VT100 codes.
             - fixed editor bug clearing entire line.
             - wrote 'bindkey' built-in.
 8/27/92 d20 - faster built-in searching.
             - wrote 'setenv' builtin.
 8/28/92     - termcap optimizations to word completion
             - word completion now matches variables if word starts with '$'.
 8/29/92     - only executuables are expanded if the word is a command. All
               files are expanded for arguments.
 8/30/92     - words to complete no longer need to be separated with spaces,
               ';','|', and '&' are now also recognized.
 9/01/92     - 'cd' no longer reports bad pathname syntax if $home not set.

             - changed 'jobs' invocation from method 0 to method 1.
             - word completion will not occur if the word contains an '=',
               single quote or double quote.
 9/03/92     - fixed memory trashing problem in 'source'
 9/04/92     - 'ps' only displays processes with the users uid. Be sure to
               use login, or you'll be the kernel's uid and get to see all
	       of the kernel's processes as your own.
 9/10/92     - forgot to 'clc' when alias not found in 'alias foo'.
 9/20/92     - fixed open-apple mapping

             - fixed pointer bug in '~' compactor
             - wrote 256 byte buffer pool
 9/22/92     - fixed parsing bug when parsing two or more command-lines
               simultaneously.
             - wrote 1024 byte buffer pool.
             - word completion now matches built-ins
             - wordmatching ignores matches if the suffix is contained in
               the $fignore variable.

11/04/92     - fixed hashing problems.
11/17/92     - new builtin 'commands' lists all built-in commands. Try aliasing
               help to this for beginning users.

02/17/93 b03 - gshrc is now read as '@:gshrc'
03/02/93     - 'set' automatically detects changing $term and auto-peforms a
	       tset. manually typing 'tset' is no longer required though it is
	       still included.
             - prompts can now contain \n,\r,\t,\b.
03/10/93     - updated automatic variable setting code. works faster now.
             - optimized low-level string routines
03/25/93     - fixed NULL commands aborting entire command-lines.
04/04/93     - history commands can now be greater than 256 characters, though
	       when being read, they are clipped to 1024.
             - the history file location has been moved to '@:history'
             - if $ignoreeof is set, then EOF (^D) will not quit the shell.
